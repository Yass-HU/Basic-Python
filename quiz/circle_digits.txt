For a time I stood pondering on circle sizes .
The large computer mainframe quietly processed all of its assembly code .
Inside my entire hope lay for figuring out an elusive expansion .
Value : pi . Decimals expected soon . I nervously entered a format procedure .
The mainframe processed the request . Error . I , again entering it , carefully retyped .
This iteration gave zero error printouts in all — success . Intently I waited .
Soon , roused by thoughts within me , appeared narrative mnemonics relating digits to verbiage !
The idea appeared to exist but only in abbreviated fashion — little phrases typically .
Pressing on I then resolved , deciding firmly about a sum of decimals to use —
likely around four hundred , presuming the computer code soon halted !
Pondering these ideas , words appealed to me . But a problem of zeros did exist .
Pondering more , solution subsequently appeared . Zero suggests a punctuation element .
Very novel ! My thoughts were culminated . No periods , I concluded .
All residual marks of punctuation = zeros . First digit expansion answer then came before me .
On examining some problems unhappily arose . That imbecilic bug !
The printout I possessed showed four nine as foremost decimals .
Manifestly troubling . Totally every number looked wrong . Repairing the bug took much effort .
A pi mnemonic with letters truly seemed good . Counting of all the letters probably should suffice .
Reaching for a record would be helpful . Consequently , I continued ,
expecting a good final answer from computer . First number slowly displayed on the flat screen —
"3" . Good . Trailing digits apparently were right also . Now my memory scheme must probably be implementable .
The technique was chosen , elegant in scheme : by self reference a tale mnemonically helpful was ensured .
An able title suddenly existed — " Circle Digits " . Taking pen I began . Words emanated uneasily .
I desired more synonyms . Speedily I found my ( alongside me ) Thesaurus .
Rogets is probably an essential in doing this , instantly I decided . I wrote and erased more .
The Rogets clearly assisted immensely . My story proceeded ( how lovely ! ) faultlessly .
The end , above all , would soon joyfully overtake . So , this memory helper story is incontestably complete .
Soon I will locate publisher . There a narrative will I trust immediately appear , producing fame . THE END .
